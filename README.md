### Author: Loyce Tsuma
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to identify trends and patterns in civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters from 1962 to 2023. 

The goal of this analysis is to provide insights that can inform safety measures and improve the overall safety of aviation operations.



## Business Problem

### Key Insights from the Analysis

- Identifying trends and patterns in civil aviation accidents which is crucial for improving aviation safety.
- 
- Provide insights that can inform safety measures and enhance the overall safety of aviation operations.
- 
- Understanding the patterns of safety risks that lead to loss of lives and financial losses is a critical business problem

The findings are intended to be valuable for stakeholders such as:

- Airlines
- 
- Aircraft manufacturers,
- 
- Aviation regulatory bodies
- 
- Air navigation service providers
- 
- Airport authorities
- 
- Pilot unions
- 
- Training organizations.


## The Data

Data is sourced from the 'Aviation Accident Database Synopses on Kaggle` 

The dataset contains 14,444 records, each representing a unique accident or incident.

The distinct column(unique identifier) in this dataframe is the `Event Id`

Data was cleaned and additional data set created `accident_causes.csv` which details accidents caused by `Runway Condition`,`Pilot Error`,`Crew`,`Weather Conditions` and `Manufacturer`.

## Findings

### Descriptive Analysis

The most common aircraft makes involved in accidents are **Boeing**, **Cessna**, and **Piper**


### Time Series Analysis

Most accidents occur in the month oF July (the onset of Summer Season)

Most accidents occured in **1982**

### Geographical Analysis

Anchorage, AK: Highest number of accidents (419).

Miami, FL: Second highest (196).

Albuquerque, NM: Third highest (190).

### Categorical Analysis

The **Cruise Phase** had  highest number of fatal accidents 
 
The **Runway Conditions** caused the  significant accidents, with 362 incidents.

Most Accidents caused **significant damage** to the Aircrafts and **Commercial Aeroplanes** ranked 1st 

## Recommendations

- Enhance Safety Measures During Critical Phases


- Enhance Safety Measures for Top Aircraft Makes through design improvements, maintenance protocols and pilot training.

- Address Top Accident Cause to improve  Runway Safety

  - Weather Preparedness through enhanced weather forecasting and monitoring systems to provide accurate and timely information to pilots and air traffic 
controllers.

- Ensure rigorous quality control and testing procedures for aircraft manufacturers to minimize defects and potential issues.

 
- Targeted Safety Interventions for High-Risk Locations eg **Anchorage, AK**: Investigate the specific factors contributing to the high accident rate in Anchorage.


- Continuos Data Analysis  to identify emerging trends and potential risk factors and  use this data to update safety protocols and regulations.

## Conclusion

By focusing on these recommendations, the aviation industry can continue to reduce the number of accidents and enhance overall safety, ultimately saving lives and reducing financial losses.
